# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

## Project Description

I want to design a sudoku board.  The board will be 9x9 with as well as 3x3 with numbers autopopulated in the smaller boxes. The player will fill in the remaining boxes until the puzzle is solved correctly. 

## Game Logic

The game has 81 boxes in rows and columns of 9.  Some of the 81 boxes will be pre-populated (hopefully auto-populated) with numbers. The numbers in each row and column must add up to 9.  Numbers cannot be repeated in each row/column.  They can also not be repeated in each box of 9.  The game will alert players when they are placing a number that is either in the box or row/column already.  If possible would also like to have a way to keep track of candidate numbers that the player inputs.  Once the puzzle is solved I want the user to receive an alert (maybe through a cool graphic/ pop up message) that at a minimum tells them they've solved the puzzle and at a maximum includes their time, their win percentage, and the number of puzzles played.

##Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- player must be able to complete a full sudoku puzzle 
- game must alert player to incorrect number placements
- game must have a pop up message if the player solves the puzzle.

### Post-MVP Plans

- Adding in the candidate numbers
- adding a more elaborate pop up message
- maybe having easy medium and hard puzzles
