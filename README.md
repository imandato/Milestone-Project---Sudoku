# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

## Project Description

I want to design a sudoku board.  The board will be 9x9 with as well as 3x3 with numbers pre-populated/autopopulated in the smaller boxes. The player will fill in the remaining boxes until the puzzle is solved correctly. 

## Game Logic

The game has 81 boxes in rows and columns of 9.  Some of the 81 boxes will be pre-populated (hopefully auto-populated) with numbers. The numbers in each row and column must add up to 9.  Numbers cannot be repeated in each row/column.  They can also not be repeated in each box of 9.  The game will alert players when they are placing a number that is either in the box or row/column already.  If possible would also like to have a way to keep track of candidate numbers that the player inputs.  Once the puzzle is solved I want the user to receive an alert (maybe through a cool graphic/ pop up message) that at a minimum tells them they've solved the puzzle and at a maximum includes their time, their win percentage, and the number of puzzles played.

##Deliverables

### MVP Criteria

- Player must be able to complete a full sudoku puzzle 
- Game must alert player to incorrect number placements
- Game must have a pop up message if the player solves the puzzle.

### Post-MVP Plans

- Adding in the candidate numbers
- Adding a more elaborate pop up message
- Maybe having easy medium and hard puzzles
